              " 'hi there! i am 40 years old male and married. i have been diagnosed to have a papillary thyroid cancer stage 1 (t1n0m0). i have undergone near total thyroidectomy ( a portion of the left lobe was left) a month ago. my endo prescribed levothyroxin for me to take for two to three months. i approached another endo and he has a slightly different view on treatment after surgery. i am weighing my options whether to go on with radioactive iodine treatment or not. suppose i will not undergo rai treatment what other possible options do i have? what are the risks? and if i go for rai what is the possible health risks? will it affect my health? and will it have a negative effect on the thyroid gland? and may it have an effect on other organs like kidney function, thyroid function, blood pressure, thyroid hormone levels, blood sugar levels, thyroid hormones etc.? the results of the biopsy are as follows: right thyroid lobe and isthmus: nodular papillary adenocarcinoma of low grade malignant potential. left thyroid lobe: colloid goiter solitary parathyroid gland with no significant histopathology. this is the most probable diagnosis of thyroid cancer. the prognosis is very good. it is possible that the diagnosis may be misdiagnosed. it may be difficult to determine the exact diagnosis. please contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. please do not hesitate to contact your physician if you wish to discuss your diagnosis. you may also visit your doctor for more information. please be patient with your doctor. you are welcome. thanks for your help. the answers are very helpful. please keep in mind that this is a very long post and may take some time to answer. thanks. the answer may be found in the comments section of this post. thank you for your continued support. please continue to pray for the answers. thanks!',\n",
