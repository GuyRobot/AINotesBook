            "   0  hi i am from new delhi india. my dad was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer on 12/03/2012 while he was in operation theater. he was admitted to the hospital on 12. 03. 2012. the doctors told him that he should undergo a wipple procedure to remove the tumor on the head of his pancreas or liver. the surgeon did not remove the tumour on his liver. he did not open him up for further treatment. the surgery was not successful. the tumor is still present in his liver and it is still growing. it is not clear if the tumor has spread to the liver or not. it may be that the tumor may have spread to other parts of the liver. it could be that there is a tumor in the liver that is not present in the brain. it can also be a tumor that may be present in other organs. there is also a possibility that there may be a tumour that is present in some parts of his body that may have been removed by the surgeon. this is a very difficult situation to deal with. please help me. please pray for my father and his family. please be patient with us. please take care of him. please do not take any chances. please keep him in your prayers. please continue to pray for his health and well-being. please visit your doctor. please try to find a specialist to help you. please advise your doctor on how to proceed with the treatment of the cancer. please ask your doctor to consult with your doctor before you proceed with treatment. please consult your doctor for more information. please. help me please. please don't leave the tumor in your home. please make sure that it does not spread to any other organs in your house. please give your help to your family and friends. please please help your doctor and your family. help. help your father. help him. help his family and his health. help us all. help! help us. thanks. gagan gdhawan1981@gmail. com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           hi i am from new delhi india. my dad was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer on 12/03/2012 while he was in operation theater. doctor stop the operation. now they are saying only kemo will help. i was supposed to have the wipple procedure but when the doctors opened him up they saw that the cancer had already spread to his liver. the surgeon did not remove the tumor on his pancreas or liver and just closed him back up. my understanding that there are 8 to 10 small mets on his liver that look like small rice-like granules. i believe they are isolated to only one lobe of the liver. we were told that chemotherapy was our only option at this point but given that it is only a palliative measure so we are obviously looking for other viable options. pl help me my father is at 65yrs & fit n fine before this operation. he will be going to discharged frm hospital on 20. 03. 12. then cemo will start. i have been told that he will have to go to the hospital for the next 6 months. i am devastated to learn that my uncle will not be able to begin chemotherapy sooner. i don't understand why he would leave the tumor there. i know that he is still alive. my uncle is still in the hospital. he is going to discharge frm from hospital on 21. 03 - 12. and then cmo will start on 28. 03, 2012. pl. pl please help me. what to do i was devastated to learning that the surgeonDid not removeThe tumor on the head of his pancareas. the surgeons said that he left the tumor There so my uncle could begin chemotherapy earlier. i can't believe that he wouldn't leave that \"ticking time bomb\" inside of him and it pains me to know that it are still inside him and growing even as i type this post thanks gagan gdhawan1981@gmail. com\n",

            "   5  hi there! i am 40 years old male and married. i have been diagnosed to have a papillary thyroid cancer stage 1 (t1n0m0). i have undergone near total thyroidectomy ( a portion of the left lobe was left) a month ago. my endo prescribed levothyroxin for me to take for two to three months. i approached another endo and he has a slightly different view on treatment after surgery. i am weighing my options whether to go on with radioactive iodine treatment or not. suppose i will not undergo rai treatment what other possible options do i have? what are the risks? and if i go for rai what is the possible health risks? will it affect my health? and will it have a negative effect on the thyroid gland? and may it have an effect on other organs like kidney function, thyroid function, blood pressure, thyroid hormone levels, blood sugar levels, thyroid hormones etc.? the results of the biopsy are as follows: right thyroid lobe and isthmus: nodular papillary adenocarcinoma of low grade malignant potential. left thyroid lobe: colloid goiter solitary parathyroid gland with no significant histopathology. this is the most probable diagnosis of thyroid cancer. the prognosis is very good. it is possible that the diagnosis may be misdiagnosed. it may be difficult to determine the exact diagnosis. please contact your doctor if you have any questions or concerns. please do not hesitate to contact your physician if you wish to discuss your diagnosis. you may also visit your doctor for more information. please be patient with your doctor. you are welcome. thanks for your help. the answers are very helpful. please keep in mind that this is a very long post and may take some time to answer. thanks. the answer may be found in the comments section of this post. thank you for your continued support. please continue to pray for the answers. thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            hi there! i am 40 years old male and married. i've been diagnosed to have a papillary thyroid cancer stage 1 (t1n0m0). i have undergone near total thyroidectomy ( a portion of the left lobe was left) a month ago. my endo prescribed levothyroxin for me to take for two to three months. i approached another endo and he has a slightly different view on treatment after surgery. i am weighing my options whether to go on with radioactive iodine treatment or not. suppose i will not undergo rai treatment what other possible options do i have? what are the risks? and if i go for rai what is the possible health risks? will it affect my ability to function? will i be able to function in other organs like kidney sexual desire etc.? the surgery did not include removal of any lymph node. this is the biopsy:right thyroid lobe and isthmus: nodular papillary adenocarcinoma of low grade malignant potential. left thyroid lobe: colloid goiter gland with no significant histopathology demonstated. thanks for the answers\n",

            "   0  hi gagan welcome to the ehealthforum and i am really glad to help you out. i can understand your concern for your uncle but the surgeon was absolutely right in abandoning the whipple's procedure on seeing the metastasis to the liver. once the tumor has metastasized to the liver it becomes a stage 4 pancreatic cancer. unfortunately majority of the patients don't live more than 6 months and only a few survive up to one year once the diagnosis is confirmed. the only option available presently is chemotherapy. i sincerely hope that helps. take care.\n",
            "   1  most gi illnesses don't cause pain in one's arm and so i would suggest that your doctors make sure that this pain you are experiencing is not related to any potential heart disease. beyond this suggestion there are many potential causes of upper abdominal pain including acid reflux (which almost always improves on acid-reducting medications) helicobacter pylroi infection (which requires both acid-reducing medications and antibiotics) bile (alkaline) reflux gastritis (which does not respond to acid-reducing medications) hiatal hernias gallstones biliary dyskinesia (abnormal function of the galbladder and bile duct sphincter muscle) chronic pancreatitis kidney stones and irritable bowel syndrome among others. since i am not involved in your care i'm afraid that i really cannot speculate as to what precisely is causing your symptoms. i hope that you can find a good gastroenterologist who can try and help to sort things out for you. sincerely robert a. wascher md facs www. doctorwascher. com author \"a cancer prevention guide for the human race\" (2010)\n",

            "   3  semen analysis is not suitable to diagnose prostate ca. azoospermia has to be established before declaring sterility. this re testing is most likely a part of that very protocol to detect any viable number that could lead to impregnation. though vasectomy is very safe method and only 1 % failure rate is there retesting at three weeks is ideal to confirm azoospermia. wishing you best of health thanks\n",
            "   4  it could be varicocele benign tumor or normal cord structures. a urological examination and subsequently an ultrasound can be advised to look for any suspicious lump. the exam should also include lymph node exam. blood counts metabolic profile and urinalysis should also be advised. wishing you best of health thanks\n",
            "   5  radioactive iodine (rai) is often chosen for treatment of conditions associated with overactive thyroid including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers. rai treatment is based on the fact that the thyroid actively accumulates iodine which it uses to produce thyroid hormones required for normal body function. the therapeutic action of rai is via disruption of the function of the thyroid cells - the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function. as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear. in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc. there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function. but once the treatment is completed you will need lifelong therapy with thyroxine supplements to prevent hypothyroidism related symptoms.\n",
            "   6  an ultrasound of the neck region should be done along with an ent consultation to look for any thyroid mass vocal cord paralysis or abnormal growth. a midline lump can be due to a thyroglossal cyst and a lateral one could be a branchial cyst. based on the clinical findings thyroid function tests and blood counts or a biopsy may be advised if the need be. wishing you best of health thanks\n",

            "   0  hi i am from new delhi india. my dad was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer on 12/03/2012 while he was in operation theater. doctor stop the operation. now they are saying only kemo will help. my dad was supposed to have the wipple procedure but when the doctors opened him up they saw that the cancer had already spread to his liver. the surgeon did not remove the tumor on his pancreas or liver and just closed him back up. my understanding that there are 8 to 10 small mets on his liver that look like small rice-like granules. i believe they are isolated to only one lobe of the liver. we were told that chemotherapy was our only option at this point but given that it is only a palliative measure so we are obviously looking for other viable options. pl help me my father is at 65yrs & fit n fine before this operation. he will be going to discharged frm hospital on 20. 03. 12. then cemo will start on 28. 03. 2012. pl. pl please help me. what to do i was devastated to learn that the surgeon did not remove the tumor on the head of his pancreas. the surgeon said that he left the tumor there so my uncle could begin chemotherapy sooner. i don't understand why he would leave that \"ticking time bomb\" inside of him and it pains me to know that it is still inside him and growing even as i type this post thanks gagan gdhawan1981@gmail. com\n",
